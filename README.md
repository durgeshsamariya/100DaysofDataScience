# 100DaysofDataScience
A 100 Day DS Challenge to learn and implement DS concepts ranging from the beginner of Data Science to Data Scientist.

According to [Harvard](https://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century), Data Scientist is the **Sexiest** job of the 21st century.

## Day 0 | 11 August 2020

D-Day is here and finally, I am accepting 100 days of data sciecne code challenge.

Today I am starting a challenge, which is “100-Days-Of-Data-Science-Code” and the intuition behind this to dedicate at least one hour of every day for next 100 days in studying and/or coding Data Science concepts. I will share my progress via :

GitHub: https://github.com/themlphdstudent/100DaysofDataScience

Twitter : https://www.twitter.com/@themlphdstudent

Instagram : https://www.instagram.com/@themlphdstudent
