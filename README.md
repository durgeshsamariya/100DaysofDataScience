# 100DaysofDataScience
A 100 Day Data Science Challenge to learn and implement DS concepts ranging from the beginner of Data Science to Data Scientist.

According to [Harvard](https://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century), Data Scientist is the **Sexiest** job of the 21st century.
